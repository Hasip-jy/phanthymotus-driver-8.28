"""ControlSink — every check a command passes before it reaches a motor.

One shared implementation rather than one per driver. There are fourteen
bundles in this repo; a safety chain copied fourteen times is a safety chain
that diverges fourteen ways, and the copy that drifts is the one on the robot
you are not looking at.

The chain, in order. The distinction between *dropped* and *rejected* runs
through all of it: dropped is the network being a network, rejected is somebody
having wired something up wrong, and only the second is worth waking a person
for.

  1. contract        schema / mode / dof / unit quaternions      → REJECTED
  2. freshness       ttl expiry, stale observation, seq regress  → DROPPED
  3. arbitration     priority, then latest seq                   → DROPPED
  4. step clamp      max_delta_per_step                          → CLAMPED
  5. hard limits     position bounds, max_velocity               → REJECTED
  6. collision       *not implemented* — see below
  7. force-torque    per-axis absolute threshold                 → ABORTED
  8. continuity      *caller's job* — see below
  9. watchdog        no valid command within watchdog_ms         → hold
 10. escalation      N consecutive watchdog periods              → stand down

**The two ways this stops are not the same stop, and conflating them cost a
robot an afternoon.** A force-torque abort means the arm hit something: the next
command is precisely the one that must not run, so it latches and only `reset()`
clears it. A watchdog escalation means nobody has spoken for a while — its job,
per step 10's own reasoning below, is to escalate the *response* so the arm does
not hang in the air while an agent believes the action is still running. It is
not a fault report, and it must not need a human.

Making both latch produced a rule that contradicted itself: silence for four
watchdog periods resumed on its own, silence for five needed an operator to tear
the card down and rebuild it. Nothing about the robot differs across that 200 ms.
Worse, the thing that routinely produces it is ordinary — restarting the card
upstream takes longer than five periods, so reconfiguring a policy bricked the
driver until somebody noticed.

A stood-down sink therefore resumes on the next command that passes every check
above. That is safe for the same reason the ordinary watchdog hold is safe:
freshness (step 2) means a resuming command was computed from a recent
observation, and the step clamp (step 4) still holds against `_last_values`,
which survives. Whatever wires this class to a topic should announce the
resumption, exactly as it should for a hold.

Two of those are honest gaps rather than implementations:

**6. Collision re-validation is not here and cannot be faked.** MoveIt Pro
checks every point of a chunk against a planning scene, with padding, and keeps
monitoring the scene so that an object appearing mid-run stops the robot. We
have no planning scene — only a URDF from a driver's `resource` tool, with no
scene representation and no FK/collision runtime. `workspace` (an optional
Cartesian bounding box in the descriptor) catches a policy running away; it
catches nothing at all on a tabletop. Until a scene representation exists, the
real mitigations are procedural: run in simulation until you trust the policy,
then first real runs at reduced speed with a person and a physical e-stop.

**8. Continuity — smoothing, densifying and blending chunks, and sizing the
committed window — belongs to whatever executes a trajectory, which is the
driver's own controller.** It is named in the chain because it is part of
getting this right, not because this class does it. One consequence is worth
stating where the driver author will read it: the committed window must be at
least the p99 inference latency or the robot pauses between chunks, and the
larger it is the longer e-stop takes to actually stop — that trade-off has to
be made deliberately and reported in `info()`, not defaulted.

**A pause is not a safe state.** When commands stop arriving the robot holds,
and it resumes the moment a valid command lands — without warning. The `ttl_ms`
check is what keeps it from resuming on a stale command, so `ttl_ms` has to be
set from measured latency; set it generously and the protection is gone while
still appearing to be there. Whatever wires this class to a topic should
announce the resume on the activity stream.

ROS-free on purpose, like `common/lifecycle.py`: decoding a topic is the
driver's job, a plain dict arrives here, and the whole chain is testable with a
fake clock on a laptop. See tests/test_control_sink.py.
