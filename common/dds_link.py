"""The link to a robot's own DDS, brought up with retries instead of once.

`ChannelFactoryInitialize` is called at bundle start, and on r1_sz that start
happened three seconds before its network interface existed::

    09:12:40  [bundle] namespace=ubuntu mcp_port=15702
    09:12:43  [bundle] DDS init failed on 'eth10': channel factory init error.
              python3: eth10: does not match an available interface.

eth10 came up a moment later and stayed up all day. Nothing retried. Every
state topic on that robot — odometry, IMU, joints, battery, mainboard — was
empty from boot until somebody looked, while the cards that publish them sat on
the canvas looking healthy and declaring in `topic_out` that they publish at
10 Hz.

Two separate defects, and this module is about both:

**The interface list was enumerated once.** The fallback scan for an address on
`192.168.123.x` ran at the same instant as the failure, so it found nothing
either. Retrying a stale list would be pointless; the candidates have to be
recomputed on every attempt, because the thing being waited for is precisely an
interface that does not exist yet.

**Failure was reported and then forgotten.** One `print`, one `logger.warn`,
and afterwards every layer — the tool schema, `topic_out`, the canvas — said the
same thing it says when the link is fine. `status()` exists so a card can put
the truth where somebody will see it.

── on the module-level singleton ────────────────────────────────────────────

`ChannelFactory` in the vendored SDK is already a process-wide singleton, and
the DDS domain it owns genuinely is one per process. Threading a link object
through every plugin constructor would add a parameter that can only ever hold
one value, and would let a caller believe two links are possible. So this keeps
one, and says why.

── retrying is safe against the vendored SDK ────────────────────────────────

`ChannelFactory.Init` returns True immediately once `__initialized` is set, so
a retry after success costs nothing; and it leaves `__initialized` False when
domain creation raises, so a retry after failure genuinely re-attempts. Both
behaviours are load-bearing here and were checked against
`unitree_sdk2py/core/channel.py` rather than assumed.
