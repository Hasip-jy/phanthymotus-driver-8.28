"""Bringing the robot's DDS link up when it is not there yet.

Every test here is about one failure on r1_sz: the bundle started three seconds
before its network interface existed, the single `ChannelFactoryInitialize`
attempt failed, and every state topic on that robot stayed empty from boot —
while the cards publishing them declared 10 Hz in `topic_out` and looked
healthy on the canvas.

Two defects, and they need separate tests because fixing one without the other
leaves the robot equally broken and equally quiet.
