"""A user barge-in has to actually stop the robot. Today, on Tianyi, it does not.

This file pins the defect as an executable assertion, and pins the simulator's
card naming as the contrast that makes it visible.

## The mechanism, read out of agent-core on 2026-09-18

`_interrupt_active_outputs` (`agent-core/src/event/llm.py:1457`) is what a
TurnCancelled — a user talking over the robot — reaches:

    results = await hooks.fire('on_interrupt_all')
    if results:
        ...
        return                                    # <-- early return
    # fallback: hardcoded lookup
    for short_name, action in (('tts', 'interrupt'), ('loco', 'stop_move')):

Three facts turn that into a silent failure:

1. `hooks.register` (`src/hooks.py:35`) registers bindings **straight from the
   `x-hooks` field of a tool schema**. Declaring a hook *is* the binding; no
   canvas wiring and no user action is involved.
2. `hooks.fire` (`src/hooks.py:167`) appends an entry for every binding it ran,
   **including ones that raised** — errors become `{'error': ...}` results
   rather than being dropped. So `results` is non-empty whenever a binding
   merely *exists*, whether or not it did anything.
3. Therefore one card declaring `on_interrupt_all` suppresses the hardcoded
   fallback for **every** card in the fleet.

On Tianyi the `servo` card declares `on_interrupt_all` and is enabled by default.
Its navigation cards (`nav`, `controlled_spatial`) declare only
`on_interrupt_motion`, which a barge-in never fires. Neither is named `loco`, and
`tts` is only reachable through the fallback that never runs.

Net effect of a barge-in on Tianyi: the servo pauses, and **speech and navigation
both continue**. Nothing is logged that says so.

The simulator's locomotion card is therefore named `loco`, with a `stop_move`
action, and declares `on_interrupt_all` itself — so it stops whichever path the
code takes. Running the same barge-in against both is what makes the defect
visible as a difference rather than an argument.

These assertions read the real driver sources structurally with `ast` rather than
executing them: tianyi's `device.py` is 7k lines behind vendor ROS imports, and a
grep would not survive reformatting.
