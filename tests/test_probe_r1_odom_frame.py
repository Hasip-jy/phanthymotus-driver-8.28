"""The frame probe, against runs whose frame we chose.

`scripts/probe_r1_odom_frame.py` exists to settle a question nobody can answer by
reading code, and its answer will be used to change a declaration that a robot's
stuck detection depends on. So the analyser is tested the only way it can be:
generate a robot trajectory, express its velocity in a known frame, and check the
probe names that frame.

The indeterminate cases matter as much as the positive ones. A probe that reports
a verdict from a run carrying no information is worse than no probe — it would
produce a confident wrong answer from a robot walking in a straight line, which
is what a first attempt on hardware looks like.
