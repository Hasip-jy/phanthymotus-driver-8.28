"""Continuous chassis control for Unitree R1 — the first `twist` card in this repo.

`loco` in device.py is the call-shaped path: one `tools/call` per motion, chosen
by an LLM or a person. Right for "walk forward for two seconds", wrong for a
navigation policy, which emits a velocity ten times a second and is not waiting
for an answer to each one. Same split as `arm` versus `servo` on G1, and the
reasoning is in that file's module docstring.

This card is the stream-shaped path. The action space is `motus.control/1`'s
`twist`: six numbers, body frame, `[vx, vy, vz, wx, wy, wz]`. R1 actuates three
of them.

── twist is a velocity space, and the sink was built for position spaces ─────

`ControlSink`'s chain is the same, but two limit fields change meaning, which is
the thing to get right here and is easy to get wrong silently:

* `limits.lower/upper` bound the **velocity** — still exactly right.
* `max_delta_per_step` is the difference between consecutive commands, so here
  it is an **acceleration** cap. Also right, and the field that keeps a policy
  from kicking the chassis.
* `max_velocity` is delta over dt, which in a velocity space is **jerk**. It has
  no useful meaning, so it is deliberately **not declared** — `parse_descriptor`
  takes it as optional, so omitting it is the correct action rather than a
  workaround.

── the three axes R1 does not have ───────────────────────────────────────────

`vz`, `wx` and `wy` are pinned `lower == upper == 0` rather than left wide. A
policy that believes it is commanding vertical motion is then **rejected** by
the sink, loudly, instead of having a third of its output silently dropped. The
vector is six wide either way; what is being chosen here is whether the
disagreement is visible.

── one chassis, two cards ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`loco` and this card hold the same `RpcProxy` and both call `Move`. Matching
`x-resource` does **not** keep them apart — ACP arbitrates its own scheduling,
not two different routes to one motor. So the two are explicitly wired together:
this card refuses to start while `loco` has a motion in flight, and `loco`'s own
`move`/`stop_move` pause this one first. An explicit instruction from a person
outranks a running policy, never the other way round. See README_dev.md
§ "x-resource is a label, not a lock".

# at all; translating, a commanded 0.05 rad/s is visible. Twenty times smaller.
#
# This is why the standstill numbers above must not be treated as constants. A
# consumer that lifts every yaw command to 1.0 while the robot is mid-approach
# overshoots a 0.05 rad/s correction by a factor of twenty, then reverses, then
# overshoots again — which on r1_sz looked like the robot weaving left and right
# on its way to a target it was already facing.
#
# So the deadband is declared twice: `min_magnitude` for an axis moving on its
# own, `min_magnitude_moving` for the same axis while translation is already
# under way. vx/vy are repeated unchanged because nothing has measured whether
# *their* floor moves, and inventing a smaller one would be the same mistake in
# the other direction.

    **An acceleration cap finer than the deadband is not a cap — it is dead
    time.** The step clamp is applied to the command the policy sends, so a
    0.30 rad/s cap against a 1.0 rad/s floor ramps 0.30 → 0.60 → 0.90 → 1.0, and
    the robot executes precisely none of the first three: three ticks of
    silence, then the turn starts at full speed. That asymmetry — slow to start,
    instant to stop, because the ramp *down* crosses the floor on its first
    step — is what a lurch is made of, and neither the sink nor the SDK reports
    anything, because from their side every command was accepted.

    So the smallest meaningful step on a deadbanded axis is the deadband. Above
    the floor the configured cap is coarser than intended, which is a real cost
    and the honest one: it is the granularity the chassis has. Shaping
    acceleration below the floor is the gait controller's job, not ours.
