"""
Socket Bridge Server - Receives messages via Unix socket and publishes to domain 42.

This process runs independently, allowing it to communicate with agent-core
while the main process uses domain 0 for body controller.

Architecture:
    Main process (domain 0, dds_profile.xml)
        → Plugins use BridgedPublisher
        → Send via Unix socket
        → This bridge process
        → Publish to domain 42 (inherits DDS config from environment)
        → Agent Core receives

Usage:
    python3 socket_bridge.py [--config config.yaml]
