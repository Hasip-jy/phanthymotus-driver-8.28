"""Which frame is R1's `rt/odommodestate.velocity` in? — read-only.

**This script sends nothing.** It subscribes to one DDS topic and prints
arithmetic. Somebody else has to move the robot while it runs; walking it by
remote or from the dashboard is enough, and so is being pushed.

── the question ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`unitree/r1/device.py` publishes `motus.odom/1` with `frame: "body"`, taken from
`rt/odommodestate`. But that topic's `position` is odometry-frame (world), and a
velocity sitting in the same message as a world-frame position is at least as
likely to be world-frame too. Rule 3 of the format exists for exactly this:

    Body versus world is the most dangerous ambiguity here [...] Guessing wrong
    gives plausible numbers with the lateral sign flipped whenever the robot is
    not facing along world x.

Nothing detects the mistake. `common/odom.py` takes the declared frame as given,
and so does the consumer (`actucore/plugins/navi/odom.py` only checks that the
sample *says* body). So the robot has to be asked.

── the method, and the assumption it must not make ──────────────────────────

One message carries `position`, `velocity` and `imu.rpy[2]` (world yaw). Between
two messages, `position` moves by `dp`. Then:

    velocity is world  ⟹  dp ≈ v · dt
    velocity is body   ⟹  dp ≈ R(yaw) · v · dt

The first version of this script compared the two residuals and took the smaller
one. That **assumed `position` was trustworthy**, and on r1_sz it is not: over a
walk a human described as roughly twelve metres of path with three metres of net
displacement, `velocity` integrated to 12.39 m path / 3.14 m net while `position`
claimed 6.35 m / 0.97 m and never left a 0.91 x 0.73 m box. Position understates
the path by about 2x and the net displacement by 3x. So a residual against it
cannot settle anything, and for three runs the script kept reporting "neither
hypothesis fits" — which was true, and not because either frame was wrong.

**What survives is the rotation, because it is scale-free.** Fitting one complex
gain per hypothesis separates the two questions: its phase is the rotation the
hypothesis still needs, its magnitude is how far the two sources disagree about
distance. A hypothesis in the right frame needs ~0 deg of extra rotation whatever
its scale. On r1_sz: body +0.2 deg, world -144 deg. That is the verdict, and it
holds even though the magnitudes disagree 4x.

The magnitude disagreement is then reported as its own finding rather than as a
failure — this method cannot say which of the two sources is wrong, so it prints
both reconstructed trajectories (net displacement, path length, bounding box) for
a human who watched the walk to recognise. That is what settled it here.

**Yaw has to vary, or the test cannot answer.** At constant yaw the rotation is a
constant and the two hypotheses differ by that constant rather than by their
shape, so a straight walk satisfies both. The run is refused unless the robot both
travelled and turned. An honest "cannot tell" is the point: the alternative is a
confident answer from a run that carried no information.

── running it ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Needs `unitree_sdk2py` and the robot's DDS, so the simplest place is inside the
driver container on the robot (the image flattens the bundle, so the script lands
at `/work/`, not `/work/scripts/`):

    ssh unitree@10.100.128.238          # r1_sz; r1_bj is unitree@10.100.130.6
    docker exec -it embodied-unitree-r1 python3 -u /work/probe_r1_odom_frame.py \
        --until-decisive --seconds 600

`--until-decisive` is the one to use when a person has to walk the robot: it waits
for the motion instead of for a clock, printing how much travel and heading change
it has so far, and stops as soon as the data can answer. Five runs on r1_sz were
taken with a fixed window and three of them caught a stationary robot.

Walk it **3 m or more with at least one substantial turn** — a straight line
cannot answer the question, for the reason given above. Every run is saved, so
re-analysis (`--load`) never costs another walk.
